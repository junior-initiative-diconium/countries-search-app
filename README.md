# Country API Frontend

In this little React app, you can search and filter through a [public countries API](https://restcountries.com/#endpoints-all), that gives you all sorts of information about a country, like population, flag, continent, currency, language and even time zones. I decided to only show the country's name, population, capital and region, but one can always expand the list of information grapped from the API at a later point.

I made this small project with the help of a [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search-and-filter-component-in-reactjs/). The tutorial gave good information but it was a bit outdated, so the API was altered since the tutorial was created. That's why I had to research a little bit, but it wasn't hard to find the new functioning endpoints of the Country API. This challenge is also on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) and I would like to do more from now on to improve my frontend skills.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory's root, you can run various scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
